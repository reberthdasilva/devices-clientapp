# NinjaRMM


This project was created using **CRA** (create-react-app), **Axios**, **React Icons**, **React Router Dom**, and **Styled Components**.

The folder structure is basically the folder **"src"**, and inside we have the folder **"components"** (that was created based on the pattern **Atomic Design**), and **"services"** (that is used to organize the service methods).


## Running the project

1- To run the project you need to have the project **"devicesTask_serverApp"** running locally on **port 3000**, or you can change the **.env** file at the root of the application to any other endpoint that you want.

2- After cloning this project you need to run "yarn install" (or use npm if you prefer) and after that "yarn start".
